## Overview

dsh-usage-plugin is a **usage & cost tracker** plugin in the DeepSeek Harness ecosystem (a DSH plugin shipped as a Host + Client two-in-one package). After installation, **"Usage & Cost"** and **"Balance Query"** tabs appear in the Web UI, right after "Conversation" and "Trace":

> Supports **Windows / macOS / Linux**: paths are handled per platform (`node:path`), and the folder picker / "reveal in file manager" use each OS's native mechanism (macOS: `osascript` / `open`; Linux: `zenity` / `xdg-open`). Balance query and export do not depend on Windows-only commands.

- **Usage & Cost**: records each model call's token usage and cache hits (input miss / cache hit / cache write / output / reasoning / finish reason), and computes cost using DeepSeek's peak/valley or base pricing (peak hours on weekdays are automatically priced by Beijing time 09:00–12:00 and 14:00–18:00; since 2026-08-23 weekends are billed entirely at the off-peak rate). Model names come from the actual request parameters, so non-DeepSeek models are shown truthfully instead of "unknown model"; models without an official price are counted as 0. The overview shows a by-model table plus a by-API-provider × model drill-down (each provider grouped with every model's calls and peak/off-peak cost split) and a grand total row. The overview also supports **date filtering** (Today / Last 7 days / Last 30 days / All, plus a custom start–end range), so the aggregate stats can be scoped to any single day or date range.
- **Usage Calendar**: a monthly daily-usage heatmap (colored by cost or call count), hover for details including the peak/off-peak cost split, click a day for its call list and peak/off-peak totals, plus a per-day statistics table with peak cost / off-peak cost / total columns and rollups. Supports **date-range filtering** (Today / 7 days / 30 days / All plus custom start–end dates): when a range is active, the daily stats table shows every day in range across months, the top cards switch to "Calls in range / Cost in range" with range totals, and the heatmap only colors days inside the range.
- **Cache Hit List**: newest-first, fully scrollable, with quick filters (Today / 7 days / 30 days / All) and custom date ranges; the summary line and footer total split peak vs off-peak consumption with a grand cost total. The list is paginated (100 rows per page), so it stays smooth even with large data volumes.
- **Interrupted calls shown truthfully**: calls that were aborted / errored / timed out (e.g. manually stopped generation, stream interruption) are shown with a red **"Interrupted"** badge, the finish reason (Interrupted / Error / Timeout) and a `—` cost. The official console still counts these as API requests and bills their actual tokens, but the harness does not report their usage to the plugin — so the plugin records them at 0 tokens, keeping the **call count aligned with the official console** while costs are unaffected. The Overview's "Calls" card adds a `· interrupted N (not billed)` hint.
- **Local stats vs official console**: a fixed notice banner at the top of the panel explains that this panel reflects calls captured locally by the plugin (official prices + peak/off-peak hours), and that the official console (platform.deepseek.com usage page) may show a higher amount because: ① interrupted/failed/timed-out calls are still billed by the console while the plugin records them as 0; ② calls from other API keys on your account (other apps/scripts) do not pass through DeepSeek Harness — the console includes them, the plugin does not; ③ for exact reconciliation, export the official monthly billing CSV and compare. When interrupted calls are detected, the banner also shows a red "Current records include N interrupted call(s) (not billed)" line.
- **Price Table**: the official DeepSeek API price table (covering `deepseek-v4-flash` / `deepseek-v4-flash-vision-exp` / `deepseek-v4-pro`) — base and peak/valley unit prices shown side by side (peak vs off-peak), editable in-panel and persisted to `pricing.json`, with a reset-to-default option.
- **Balance Query**: queries your DeepSeek account balance using the configured `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`.
- **Export**: CSV / JSON / **PNG long image** (newest-first, up to the latest 2000 records, warns if exceeded; the PNG report includes peak/off-peak cost columns), to any directory (native picker), auto-opens the folder after export.
- **Import**: merge-imports JSON / CSV files, deduplicated by time.
- **Persistence**: records are written live to `<session workspace>/dsh-usage/usage-records.json` and restored on restart (cap 100000 records).
- **UI adaptation**: panel typography scales with the app's display-size setting (em-relative fonts); wide tables scroll horizontally on desktop (`max-content` + `overflow-x`) and **fit the screen width on mobile (≤900px, no horizontal scrollbar)**; popup cards adapt to the viewport.
- **English UI (i18n)**: the panel follows the harness's own language setting (General Settings → Language) — switch it there and the plugin follows instantly, no separate toggle, no `localStorage` override. The bilingual dictionary covers the whole panel, the peak/off-peak billing-period hints, the balance query and the PNG report; host-level Conversation/Settings tab labels are re-read per render, so they follow the language switch live.
- **Per-message token popup**: when a turn finishes, the assistant message's footer action row shows a **"Turn tokens"** button; clicking opens a `Token Details` popup in two layers — **Conversation total** (the whole session's total tokens / total cost / run time / cache-hit rate) and **This turn** (this output's tokens, turn tokens, turn cost, turn duration, turn cache-hit rate, a cache-hit bar, and per-model cards showing each model's input·miss / cache hit / output (+ reasoning) plus its peak/off-peak cost split). Durations are shown as `Xm Ys`. Each usage record is tagged with the conversation (`sessionId`), so per-turn and per-conversation stats are computed independently.
- **Internal/tool calls grouped separately**: internal/placeholder calls (e.g. `dsh2shell-*` with model `fake`) are excluded from the model cost breakdown and collected in a collapsible **"Tool calls (internal)"** group below the breakdown, so only real model calls count in the cost tables.
- **Mobile adaptation**: tables fit the screen width on ≤900px (no horizontal scrollbar); wide tables collapse the middle columns; the popup and its stat cards / per-model cards adapt to the viewport.

## Recommended Installation

> Either method works and is equivalent. **We recommend the desktop app** — fully graphical, no command line needed.

### Option 1 (recommended): One-click via the desktop app

Install [DeepSeek Harness Desktop](https://github.com/feiyang-dev/DeepSeek-Harness-Desktop), open it, then go to **"Install Plugins" → Recommended → Usage & Cost Tracker → Install** and click **"Restart Service Now"** to activate.

### Option 2: Command line

```bash
# Prerequisite: install dsh (npm install -g @deepseek-ai/dsh)
dsh plugin --profile web add @feiyang666/dsh-usage-plugin
```

Or install to another profile:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add @feiyang666/dsh-usage-plugin
dsh plugin --profile headless add @feiyang666/dsh-usage-plugin
```

Restart the dsh web service after installation. Detailed manual install / wiring / uninstall / troubleshooting follows below.

---

## What's in the package

One npm package = a **host half** (Node-side Cordis plugin: recording, billing, balance query, export — see `lib/index.js`) + a **client half** (browser-side panel — see `lib/client.js`, which talks to the host via `/usage/api`).

The package integrates with DSH through two declarations:

| Declaration | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `dsh.bundle.patch` (`cordis.patch.yml`) | Lets DSH recognize it as a **standard bundle plugin package**: `dsh plugin --profile <name> add <package>` installs and wires it in one command, no manual config editing |
| `dsh.client` + `exports["./client"]` | Lets the web client auto-load the browser panel at `/plugins/<package>/client.js` |

So for users, **installation is one command** — no YAML editing, no manual file copying.

---

## Installation (for users)

### 0. Prerequisites

- DeepSeek Harness installed (`npm install -g @deepseek-ai/dsh`, or a desktop app built on it, or `npx @deepseek-ai/dsh web`).
- Option A (recommended) needs **pnpm**: `npm install -g pnpm` (or `corepack enable`).
- Make sure `dsh` is on PATH (for the desktop app, run in its bundled terminal).

### 1. Method A (recommended): one command

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add @feiyang666/dsh-usage-plugin
```

This does three things (all automatic):

1. Installs the package via pnpm into `~/.dsh/profiles/web` (auto-initializes the profile on first use);
2. Detects the package's `dsh.bundle` declaration and writes the package name into the profile's `dsh.profile.bundles` layer list;
3. After restart, DSH reads the package's `cordis.patch.yml` and mounts the plugin row into the app tree — **no manual config editing**.

Same for other profiles (replace `web` with your profile name, e.g. `dsh plugin --profile headless add ...`; `dsh web` equals `dsh --profile web`).

> Test a local tarball: `dsh plugin --profile web add C:\path\to\feiyang666-dsh-usage-plugin-1.9.0.tgz`

### 2. Method B: manual install (no pnpm / no `dsh plugin`)

Only for when you have no pnpm or want full manual control. **Do not `npm install` directly at `~/.dsh/profiles`** (that dir has no package.json; npm would treat the whole node_modules as residue and wipe it).

**B1. Use pnpm but not `dsh plugin`:**

```bash
cd ~/.dsh/profiles/web
pnpm add @feiyang666/dsh-usage-plugin
# then manually append the plugin row to web/cordis.patch.yml (see B3) and restart
```

**B2. Or use npm:** add a minimal package.json to the profile first, then install:

```bash
cd ~/.dsh/profiles/web
# if no package.json exists there yet (only after `dsh plugin` init):
# echo '{"name":"dsh-profile-web","private":true,"dependencies":{}}' > package.json
npm install @feiyang666/dsh-usage-plugin
```

**B3. Wire it up (once, idempotent):** append to `~/.dsh/profiles/web/cordis.patch.yml`:

```yaml
- insert:
    - id: usage-plugin
      name: '@feiyang666/dsh-usage-plugin'
      inject:
        - fs
        - webServer
        - subprocess
        - credentials
        - sandboxPolicy
        - agents
```

Or just run the package's built-in wiring script (auto-finds the profile and appends, idempotent):

```bash
node node_modules/@feiyang666/dsh-usage-plugin/scripts/wire.js
```

> ⚠️ The `inject` list is **required**: it makes Cordis wait until `fs` / `webServer` / `subprocess` / `credentials` / `sandboxPolicy` / `agents` are ready before activating the plugin. Without it the `/usage/api` route never registers and the panel fails with `Unexpected end of JSON input`.

### 3. Method C: desktop app

The desktop app (e.g. [DeepSeek Harness Desktop](https://github.com/feiyang-dev/DeepSeek-Harness-Desktop)) uses the same `~/.dsh/profiles` underneath. Run Method A's command in any terminal, restart the app, and the plugin activates automatically (the app starts the same `dsh web`).

### 4. Restart and verify

Restart the DeepSeek Harness web app (command line: kill the old process and re-run `dsh web`; desktop: fully quit and reopen). Then:

- Refresh http://127.0.0.1:3080 — after "Conversation" and "Trace", you should see **"Usage & Cost"** and **"Balance Query"** tabs; there are entries in Settings too.
- The "Usage & Cost" panel contains **Overview / Usage Calendar / Cache Hit List / Price Table** subtabs.
- Send a message and the "Usage & Cost" panel should show this call's token / cost record.

### 5. Configuration (for balance query)

"Balance Query" uses the configured `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`: set the API Key in **Settings → Models** (same key used for chats), then open the "Balance Query" tab and click "Query Balance".

---

## Uninstall

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web remove @feiyang666/dsh-usage-plugin
```

(Equivalent to pnpm remove; `dsh plugin` auto-removes the package name from the `dsh.profile.bundles` layer list.) Restart the app afterward.

For manual installs (Method B), do it in reverse: remove the `usage-plugin` row from `cordis.patch.yml`, then `pnpm remove` / `npm uninstall` the package, and restart.

> Upgrading from a 1.0.x manual-wiring install to 1.1.x: first remove the old `usage-plugin` row from `cordis.patch.yml` (or follow the uninstall flow), then reinstall via Method A to avoid mounting the plugin twice.

---

## How to update

Releasing happens on npm, so updating just means pulling the latest published package. Your usage history is **safe** — since v1.9.2 it lives in a fixed dedicated directory (not in any profile / workspace), so an update never wipes it.

### Desktop app
Open **"Install Plugins"** → find **Usage & Cost Tracker** → click **Update** (or **Re-install**) → **"Restart Service Now"**. If there is no Update button, just remove then re-add it.

### Command line (Method A)
Re-running `add` is idempotent and pulls the newest version:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add @feiyang666/dsh-usage-plugin
dsh web   # restart
```

Pin a specific version:

```bash
dsh plugin --profile web add @feiyang666/dsh-usage-plugin@1.9.3
```

### Manual install (Method B)
In the profile dir:

```bash
cd ~/.dsh/profiles/web
pnpm update @feiyang666/dsh-usage-plugin   # or: npm update @feiyang666/dsh-usage-plugin
```

### Verify the installed version
```bash
npm ls @feiyang666/dsh-usage-plugin --prefix ~/.dsh/profiles/web
```

> ⚠️ **Do not hand-edit files under `~/.dsh/profiles/web/node_modules/@feiyang666/dsh-usage-plugin/`** (e.g. `lib/index.js` / `lib/client.js`). Every update re-extracts the package from npm and overwrites those files, so local edits are silently lost. To change behavior, fork the repo and publish your own version, or contribute upstream.

---

## Data & locations

> **Since v1.9.2**, records are stored in a **fixed, dedicated data directory** (fixes [#4](https://github.com/feiyang-dev/dsh-usage-plugin/issues/4)). The path no longer follows the session workspace / `~/.dsh` / desktop-app install dir, so your history never "disappears" (counted as 0) when the workspace changes, and the path shown in the UI equals the on-disk path.

- **Records**: `<data root>/dsh-usage/usage-records.json`
  - Resolution order for the **data root** (data always lands in the **first writable** dir of this list, **never in the workspace** unless all of the below are unwritable):
    1. env var `DSH_USAGE_DATA_DIR` (if set) — overrides everything;
    2. Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\dsh-usage-plugin` (falls back to `%APPDATA%` if `LOCALAPPDATA` is unset);
    3. user home dir: `~/dsh-usage-data` (Windows `%USERPROFILE%\dsh-usage-data`, macOS/Linux `~/dsh-usage-data`);
    4. **fallback (rare)**: current workspace `<workspace>/dsh-usage` — only used when all system/user dirs above are unwritable, and the panel will show a "persistence disabled" warning.
  - **Writes bypass the model sandbox**: persistence is done by the host plugin process's own filesystem, not subject to the `workspace-write` sandbox, so the fixed directory is always writable and data is not lost when switching workspaces.
  - Default on Windows: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\dsh-usage-plugin\dsh-usage\usage-records.json`
- **Legacy data auto-merge**: on first start, records previously scattered in `%USERPROFILE%\dsh-usage`, `~/.dsh/dsh-usage`, and each workspace's `dsh-usage` (or `.dsh-usage-records.json`) are merged into the fixed root, deduplicated by `time` — no manual migration needed.
- Price config (edited & saved in the panel): `<data root>/dsh-usage/pricing.json`
- Default export dir: `<data root>/dsh-usage/{csv,json,images}/`
- Custom export dir: set in the panel's "Export target directory" or click "Choose directory…"
- Startup diagnostics (if the plugin fails to activate): `dsh-usage-boot.log` next to the data root

## FAQ

| Symptom | Cause / Fix |
| --- | --- |
| Panel reports `Unexpected end of JSON input` | The plugin row is missing the `inject` list, so the route isn't registered. Add the inject list per Method B3 and restart |
| Panel blank / no top tab | Plugin not activated. Check `dsh-usage-boot.log`; confirm the `cordis.patch.yml` row exists with the correct `name` |
| Balance query fails with "DEEPSEEK_API_KEY not configured" | Set the API Key in Settings → Models |
| Balance query network error | Ensure `api.deepseek.com` is reachable (configure a proxy if needed) |
| `dsh plugin` reports pnpm not found | Install pnpm: `npm install -g pnpm` |
| Install can't reach the npm registry | Set a mirror: `npm config set registry https://registry.npmmirror.com` (or `pnpm config set registry ...`) and retry |
| After uninstall, still reports `Cannot find package '@feiyang666/...'` | A package reference remains in the profile. Remove the corresponding row from `cordis.patch.yml` and the package name from `dsh.profile.bundles`, then restart |
