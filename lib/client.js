    // BUG1（切走再切回仍停在插件页签）的真实根因：
    // harness 把 conversation.view 的选择放在 per-session 的 snapshot store 里
    // （createConversationStore → defineStore({ persist: "dsh.conversation" })）。
    // 该 store 的实现是「挂载时从 localStorage 读一次，之后每次变更再写回」
    // （dsh-web-frontend bundle 的 Tc 函数）：
    //     const raw = localStorage.getItem(name); if (raw) store.setState(JSON.parse(raw));
    //     store.subscribe(next => localStorage.setItem(name, JSON.stringify(next)));
    // 渲染读的是**内存状态**（useStore(s => s.view)），所以只改 localStorage 不会
    // 改变当前渲染，store 下次变更还会把旧值写回、覆盖外部修改——之前那版就败在这里。
    // 正确做法：用 harness 传给每个 conversation.view 的 openView(view, focus) prop
    // （ConversationSession 渲染时注入，内部走 activateView + store.openView，同时更新
    // 内存与持久化）。视图挂载时若自己是被"恢复"出来的，就主动切回 chat。
